# Portfolio (Front-end) — Leonardo Pamplona

Personal portfolio website to present my profile, highlight my skills, and showcase my **backend projects** in a clean and navigable UI.

This repo is focused on the **front-end** only. Each backend project will be displayed as a card (carousel) and will have a dedicated detail page with tabs (About / Tests / Q&A / etc).

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Centralize my professional presentation (bio, skills, contact)
- Showcase backend projects with clear summaries and links to repositories
- Provide a **project detail page** per project with structured information (tabs)
- Keep the project simple to maintain and easy to evolve

---

## ✨ Planned Features (MVP)
- Home page with: About me + Skills + Projects
- Projects section with **carousel navigation**
- Project cards with:
  - Title + short description
  - Tech stack tags
  - Repository link (GitHub)
- Project detail page: `/projects/[slug]`
  - Tabs: **About**, **Tests**, **Q&A** (and optional: Architecture)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack (planned)
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn/ui + lucide-react

## 🧩 Project Data
Project content (title, tags, repo links, and tab content) will be stored locally at first (TS/JSON), so the portfolio works without a backend.
